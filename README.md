# Satellite-image-processing-in-python

Organizatiors: Serbian Case for Space, Planet (company based in San Francsisco)

Aim: to use satellite image data to find a way of solving problems in environment or smart citys.

We tought of an idea to take a focus on quality of water ( sea, river or lakes). We used pictures of satellites and mapped them in ArcGIS. Then collected data on 2 cities: Rijeka and Tirana because members were from those cities. Rijeka was a very good option cause it has a river and a port which is very crucial since a lot of enviromental damage can be caused on sea ports. The only downfall of this project was that it was difficult to find data for every month in measurements of water quality. We also used python and NDVI for mapping in our program water areas.
